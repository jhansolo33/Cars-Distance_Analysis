##  Cleaning the data
###  I first read in the dataset

##  Then the data was split into training and testing

##  Results
The data shows a very consistent correlation between Price and Distance(miles.)  There were very few "outliers" that deviated from the majority of the 7800+ vehicles in the dataset.  There is a nearly perfect relationship between the two variables.  As the number of miles(Distance) increases, the Price that is being asked for the car, decreases.

# Summary
When people are shopping to purchase a car, they can be confident that the car is reasonably priced and it will be apparently obvious if the car is underpriced or overpriced.
